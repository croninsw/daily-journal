Spent the latter half of the afternoon with minor debugging which I think puts us in a good place for tomorrow, especially with it being a short, half-day. Hopefully we can take the leads we established today and apply them to quickly tackle (debug) our code and apply a little CSS to our Nutshell before the weekend. For Day 2 out of maybe 7(?), I think our group is up to something great!",
